# AIUB-forum
A website solely for the benefits of the students of AIUB. This forum lets students post queries and get help from other peers, reply to various queries. A moderator can maintain and manage posts and the integrity of the website and an admin can manage users on top of what the moderator can do. This project was completed as the final project of my university course Web Technologies
